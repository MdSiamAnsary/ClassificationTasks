So, like, I know it's kinda cliche, but mistakes are like, super important for success, you know? Like, I mean, think about it. If we didn't make mistakes, we wouldn't learn anything new! \\n\\nI mean, like, think about it. When I was learning how to ride a bike, I fell off like, a million times. But, like, each time I got back up, I got better!  And now I can ride like, a total pro! \\n\\nBut, like, mistakes aren't just for learning how to ride a bike. They can be for, like, anything!  You know, like, in science experiments, sometimes things don't go right, but that's okay! It's like, an opportunity to learn what went wrong and how to fix it! \\n\\nAnd, like, the same thing goes for, like, sports and stuff. Sometimes you might make a mistake, but if you don't get discouraged, you can learn from it and get better! \\n\\nSo, like, the next time you make a mistake, don't be all, like, \\\"Oh no, I'm a total failure!\\\"  Instead, be all, like, \\\"Okay, what can I learn from this? How can I improve?\\\" \\n\\nAnd, like, the more you practice, the better you'll get!  So, like, don't be afraid to make mistakes. Embrace them, because they're, like, totally part of the journey to success! \\n\\nSo, like, yeah. That's my essay.  I hope you liked it!\",\n          \"Dear Principal,\\n\\nAs you may know, many students are A and B students which is above average.\\n\\nBut there are also some students who are average, which is a C. I think that the students may have a grade average of a C to play sports and other activities. One of my reasons is because it is average, in all schools a C is average and many students do have a C it is neither good or bad, its average. Making students not to be able to play any sports or any school activities will put a lot of pressure for students to get good grades, and some kids just cant get above average. Another reason is many students by playing sports and doing activities, it helps them to do better in life. By playing sports a student is doing something that they love, it helps them have better leadership skills, better team work, and overall just a better perspective on life.\\n\\nIf these kids who don't get above average grades are banned from sports and activities, they will not gain those skills that you gain when you are playing on a team, in a club or school activities. Also the students that don't have the above average grades might get encouraged by his/her family, friends, and teammates to study a little harder for a quiz, spend more time on their homework, or maybe just asking someone to help you with the things you are struggling with at school. lastly by kids getting out and playing a sport or other activities they stay healthy, make new friends, and grow closer with their families by similar interest they may have of a sport or other activities.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\",\n          \"The cafeteria at our school is an important resource for our students, offering meals that are both nutritious and tasty.

So, like, I know it's kinda cliche, but mistakes are like, super important for success, you know? Like, I mean, think about it. If we didn't make mistakes, we wouldn't learn anything new! \\n\\nI mean, like, think about it. When I was learning how to ride a bike, I fell off like, a million times. But, like, each time I got back up, I got better!  And now I can ride like, a total pro! \\n\\nBut, like, mistakes aren't just for learning how to ride a bike. They can be for, like, anything!  You know, like, in science experiments, sometimes things don't go right, but that's okay! It's like, an opportunity to learn what went wrong and how to fix it! \\n\\nAnd, like, the same thing goes for, like, sports and stuff. Sometimes you might make a mistake, but if you don't get discouraged, you can learn from it and get better! \\n\\nSo, like, the next time you make a mistake, don't be all, like, \\\"Oh no, I'm a total failure!\\\"  Instead, be all, like, \\\"Okay, what can I learn from this? How can I improve?\\\" \\n\\nAnd, like, the more you practice, the better you'll get!  So, like, don't be afraid to make mistakes. Embrace them, because they're, like, totally part of the journey to success! \\n\\nSo, like, yeah. That's my essay.  I hope you liked it!\",\n          \"Dear Principal,\\n\\nAs you may know, many students are A and B students which is above average.\\n\\nBut there are also some students who are average, which is a C. I think that the students may have a grade average of a C to play sports and other activities. One of my reasons is because it is average, in all schools a C is average and many students do have a C it is neither good or bad, its average. Making students not to be able to play any sports or any school activities will put a lot of pressure for students to get good grades, and some kids just cant get above average. Another reason is many students by playing sports and doing activities, it helps them to do better in life. By playing sports a student is doing something that they love, it helps them have better leadership skills, better team work, and overall just a better perspective on life.\\n\\nIf these kids who don't get above average grades are banned from sports and activities, they will not gain those skills that you gain when you are playing on a team, in a club or school activities. Also the students that don't have the above average grades might get encouraged by his/her family, friends, and teammates to study a little harder for a quiz, spend more time on their homework, or maybe just asking someone to help you with the things you are struggling with at school. lastly by kids getting out and playing a sport or other activities they stay healthy, make new friends, and grow closer with their families by similar interest they may have of a sport or other activities.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\",\n          \"The cafeteria at our school is an important resource for our students, offering meals that are both nutritious and tasty.

So, like, I know it's kinda cliche, but mistakes are like, super important for success, you know? Like, I mean, think about it. If we didn't make mistakes, we wouldn't learn anything new! \\n\\nI mean, like, think about it. When I was learning how to ride a bike, I fell off like, a million times. But, like, each time I got back up, I got better!  And now I can ride like, a total pro! \\n\\nBut, like, mistakes aren't just for learning how to ride a bike. They can be for, like, anything!  You know, like, in science experiments, sometimes things don't go right, but that's okay! It's like, an opportunity to learn what went wrong and how to fix it! \\n\\nAnd, like, the same thing goes for, like, sports and stuff. Sometimes you might make a mistake, but if you don't get discouraged, you can learn from it and get better! \\n\\nSo, like, the next time you make a mistake, don't be all, like, \\\"Oh no, I'm a total failure!\\\"  Instead, be all, like, \\\"Okay, what can I learn from this? How can I improve?\\\" \\n\\nAnd, like, the more you practice, the better you'll get!  So, like, don't be afraid to make mistakes. Embrace them, because they're, like, totally part of the journey to success! \\n\\nSo, like, yeah. That's my essay.  I hope you liked it!\",\n          \"Dear Principal,\\n\\nAs you may know, many students are A and B students which is above average.\\n\\nBut there are also some students who are average, which is a C. I think that the students may have a grade average of a C to play sports and other activities. One of my reasons is because it is average, in all schools a C is average and many students do have a C it is neither good or bad, its average. Making students not to be able to play any sports or any school activities will put a lot of pressure for students to get good grades, and some kids just cant get above average. Another reason is many students by playing sports and doing activities, it helps them to do better in life. By playing sports a student is doing something that they love, it helps them have better leadership skills, better team work, and overall just a better perspective on life.\\n\\nIf these kids who don't get above average grades are banned from sports and activities, they will not gain those skills that you gain when you are playing on a team, in a club or school activities. Also the students that don't have the above average grades might get encouraged by his/her family, friends, and teammates to study a little harder for a quiz, spend more time on their homework, or maybe just asking someone to help you with the things you are struggling with at school. lastly by kids getting out and playing a sport or other activities they stay healthy, make new friends, and grow closer with their families by similar interest they may have of a sport or other activities.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME\",\n          \"The cafeteria at our school is an important resource for our students, offering meals that are both nutritious and tasty.
